
This repository will contain basic, intermediate and advanced level problems which are collected for   leetcode and geeksforgeeks.

I will be solving to solve the problems using python.


The problem list was made from the suggestion of Kunal Kushwaha's Java DSA bootcam.

Here is a list of topic-wise 500+ DSA problems:

- Array
- Searching
- Sorting
- String
- Recursion
- Bitwise
- OOP
- LinkedList,
- Stack-Queue

which I made by collecting suggestions from different types of people, especially from Kunal Kushwaha.
