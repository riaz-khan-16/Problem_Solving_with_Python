When I was younger, I used to think that 41 year olds were ancient. 
But now that I'm in my 40s, I realize that age is just a number.

 I feel young in my soul and that has been a key factor in my success.

To all you young people out there - the 13, 16, 19, and 24 year olds - I wish you could feel how young
 I am in my soul right now. It would change everything you do. You'd become dramatically more patient and 
 that would help you achieve the success you want in life.

I know a lot of you are looking for shortcuts and instant gratification. But let me tell you,
 patience is the foundation of success. It's not about being complacent or lacking ambition.
  It's about staying committed to your goals and being willing to put in the time and effort 
  it takes to achieve them.

I didn't even start building my own brand until I was 34. For the first 12 years of my career,
 I was focused on building my dad's business. That required a huge amount of patience from someone 
 who thought they were great. But that patience paid off in the end.

So if you're feeling impatient or frustrated with your progress, take a step back and focus
 on the long game. Don't let instant gratification or outside validation distract you from your goals.
  Stay committed, stay patient, and success will come.
