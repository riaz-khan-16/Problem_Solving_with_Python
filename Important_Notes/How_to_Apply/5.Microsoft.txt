I'm going to share the method I used when I applied to Microsoft or other companies. (off-campus).

It is obvious that using a referral is not a novel technique to apply.

There are 4 ways you can apply for a job role. 

1.Apply directly on the career page:
2.Apply through a referral:
3.Apply via sending a mail to HR
4.Directly contact the hiring manager or the employee of that team.


1.Apply directly on the career page:
➡ This is the quickest and easiest way to apply for a job.
But it is also the hardest and takes the longest time to receive a response from HR.




2.Apply through a referral:
This is always an excellent idea, but in my opinion, practically everyone uses referrals, 
and companies like FAANG receive a huge amount of resumes this way as well.
Therefore, I believe that the chances of receiving any answer are relatively low
if there are fewer open seats.

3.Apply via sending a mail to HR

I believe that this is the greatest approach to applying for any position. 
However, it is not simple to find the HR email.
But, you can obtain one from a new employee of that company.
So, applying for a job is a bit challenging and time-consuming but highly successful.



4. Directly contact the hiring manager or the employee of that team.

 This may not be possible for everyone, but if you find the hiring manager's id or team member,
you can ask them to review your resume and explain to them why you are the right candidate.
