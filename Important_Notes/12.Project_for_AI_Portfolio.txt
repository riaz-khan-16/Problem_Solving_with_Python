In my experience, the best way to acquire knowledge is by practicing.
 If you want to switch your career to AI, GitHub is the best source of knowledge.

Some examples of code that you can adapt to your portfolio:

- Predict Customer Churn with Python
- WhatsApp Group Chat Analysis
- Deploy a Chatbot with Python
- Fake News Detection Model
- Image Segmentation

See some examples in the comments below.

In theory, theory and practice are the same, but in practice, they aren't.
