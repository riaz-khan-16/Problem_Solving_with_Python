Why you’re not receiving replies from recruiters on LinkedIn.
 I’ve put template I used to ping recruiters in this post. Keep reading.

Here are a few reasons:-
- You’re just texting hi/hello/need help/need job.
- You’re not providing entire context in your first message.
- You’re being rude.
- You’re waiting for the other person to reply your message.
- You’re texting as if you’re entitled (no kidding)

Remember this, people HATE SMALL TALK on LinkedIn.

Stop beating around the bush with hi, hello messages and 
get to the point on the very first message you send them!!

Here’s a template I used to ping recruiters always:-

“Thank you for accepting my connection request (name).

Here's a short intro about myself - I'm primarly a 
backend Java engineer (4 YoE) and I've architected and built 2-3 products from scratch 
at Autodesk and I maintain the product ownership as well. I found a couple of job roles
 from the careers page that match my skillset and experience.

Here's my resume for your reference - (resume link)
My leetcode profile - (leetcode URL)

Kindly let me know if you need any further information from my side to 
initiate the interview process. Looking forward to your reply. Thank you!”

I setup reminders on my Google calendar to follow up with
 every recruiter who hasn’t replied back every single week. 
 It’s a hectic and tiring process surely, but essential.

Here’s a follow up template I used:-

“Hello (name), just following up on my previous message. 
Could you kindly let me know if my resume and skillsets are
 good enough to be considered for the roles? I'd be happy to receive any answer.

Looking forward to your reply. Thank you.”

Had couple more templates as well, I’ll put them in comments due to word limit here.
